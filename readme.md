# Graphics Project with SDL2, OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW, and GLM




This is a graphics project written in C++ that utilizes SDL2, OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW, and GLM libraries to create graphical applications. The project aims to provide a starting point for learning graphics programming in C++.




## Prerequisites




Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:




- SDL2

- OpenGL

- GLFW

- GLEW

- GLM

- CMake (for building)
